# Score-Keeper
This is a simple score keeper widget in HTML , JavaScript , and Bulma framework for styling.
This project is from 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' course by Colt Steele on Udemy (Great course btw).

Features:
* You can set goal score ('play to'). If someone wins, the game is over and the buttons are disabled.
* Reset button - resets the scores.
* If you change the goal score, it resets the scores.
* When someone wins, it changes the colors of the scores.
